Description: This package holds an optimal linear regression function which runs all the possible combinations of linear regression
             equations. The olr function returns the equation that has the greatest adjusted R-squared term or the greatest R-squared term.
             Essentially, the olr function returns the best fit equation out of all the possible equations. Complimentary functions are included
             which list all of the equations, all of the equations in ascending order, a function to give the user a specific model's summary, 
             and the list of adjusted R-squared terms & R-squared terms. There is also a Python version avaiable online at https://pypi.org/project/olr/
